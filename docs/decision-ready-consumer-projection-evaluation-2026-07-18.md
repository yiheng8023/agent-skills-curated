# Decision-Ready Consumer Projection Evaluation

## Result

The repository-side projection is structurally decision-ready, but consumer
verification remains open. The current governed surface contains 20 approved
Skill routes and 9 Recipes. Given normalized task facts, the deterministic
resolver returns one of seven bounded outcomes—native, runtime, curated,
recipe, no-skill, ask-user, or gap—with selected IDs, confirmation reason,
validation, and fallback data.

The checked-in corpus covers 105 scenarios, all pass, every lifecycle
capability is classified, and the representative set includes all seven
decision classes. High risk, permission expansion, unresolved conflict, and
ambiguity fail closed to human confirmation.

## Burden Proxy

The baseline structural enumeration surface is 29 governed payload entries:
20 Skill routes plus 9 Recipes. The representative decision package returns
one decision class and at most two selected IDs. This supports a bounded claim
that a consumer can query a decision instead of reading every governed route.

This is a structural proxy only. It does not measure context tokens, latency,
user effort, decision quality, or live consumer benefit. It also does not prove
that a runtime capability is installed, healthy, connected, or authorized.

## Honest Assessment

`acceptance.decision-ready-consumer-projection` remains `partial`. Repository
fixtures cover representative decisions, routing outcomes, structural burden,
collision handling, maintenance binding, and claim limits. Completion still
requires dated consumer-owned verification under a separately authorized task.

No consumer configuration, Hook, runtime, generated routing output, approved
payload, release manifest, external repository, commit, or remote was changed.
