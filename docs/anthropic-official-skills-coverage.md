# Anthropic Official Skills Coverage

Inspection date: 2026-06-24  
Source: <https://github.com/anthropics/skills>  
Reviewed revision: `57546260929473d4e0d1c1bb75297be2fdfa1949`

This document treats Anthropic official Skills as a dated external baseline
and dated external capability baseline. It does not make those Skills part of
this repository's managed inventory. In short: this is not managed inventory,
not release manifest content, and not an execution path.

## Scope And Rules

- Do not blindly import the official repository.
- Do not claim full coverage merely because an Agent can usually complete a
  task with native reasoning.
- Distinguish functional ability from stable coverage of workflow, resources,
  scripts, trigger descriptions, and output standards.
- Use `covered` only when current native, runtime, ecosystem, or curated
  capability is materially sufficient for the relevant workflow.
- Use `reference` when the source is useful as dated baseline evidence but
  should not be copied, adapted, or executed.
- Use `adapt-candidate` when the capability is useful, not fully covered, and
  can only enter this repository after the normal intake path.
- Use `skip` when the Skill is product-specific, not portable, or not aligned
  with this repository's agent-neutral scope.

Anthropic official, runtime-owned, or first-party content remains external
metadata and dated overlap evidence. It is not vendored here and does not enter
`release-manifest.json`.

## License And Provenance Findings

The inspected repository does not provide a root `LICENSE` file. Licensing is
per Skill or described by repository documentation:

- Many example Skills include per-directory `LICENSE.txt` files using Apache
  License 2.0.
- `docx`, `pdf`, `pptx`, and `xlsx` include Anthropic source-available /
  all-rights-reserved terms. Their bodies, scripts, templates, and resources
  must be treated as reference-only unless separate permission is obtained.
- `doc-coauthoring` did not include a per-skill `LICENSE.txt` in the inspected
  revision. Treat it as reference or candidate-only until license provenance is
  clarified.
- `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` lists additional dependency notices, including
  media and document-processing dependencies. Any future adaptation must repeat
  dependency and redistribution review.

## Coverage Matrix

| Anthropic official Skill | Category | Purpose | Covered by Codex native? | Covered by Codex ecosystem? | Covered by existing curated Skills? | Gap / risk | Decision | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `algorithmic-art` | Creative coding | Generate algorithmic art with p5.js, seeded randomness, and parameter exploration. | Partial | Partial | No | p5.js-specific workflow, templates, and deterministic exploration are not governed here. | `adapt-candidate` / `reference` | Useful Apache-2.0 baseline, but should enter only through normal intake and overlap review. |
| `brand-guidelines` | Brand governance | Apply Anthropic brand colors and typography. | No | No | No | Anthropic-specific brand identity is not portable or user-neutral. | `skip` / `reference` | Keep as evidence that brand-specific Skills exist; do not import into an agent-neutral repository. |
| `canvas-design` | Static visual design | Create PNG/PDF visual art using design philosophy, fonts, and assets. | Partial | Partial | No | Asset/font footprint and output workflow need license and portability review. | `adapt-candidate` / `reference` | Creative workflow may be valuable, but resources must be reviewed before any adaptation. |
| `claude-api` | Provider API reference | Reference Anthropic Claude API, SDKs, models, streaming, tools, MCP, pricing, and migrations. | No | Partial | No | Provider-specific, time-sensitive API facts; native Codex/OpenAI docs do not cover Anthropic-specific details. | `reference` | Model-neutral repository may record it as external provider metadata, not import volatile provider docs as curated Skill content. |
| `doc-coauthoring` | Documentation workflow | Guide structured document co-authoring, context transfer, iteration, and reader verification. | Partial | Partial | Partial | License provenance unclear; existing writing/review Skills cover parts but not the full structured workflow. | `adapt-candidate` / `reference` | Candidate only after license clarification and overlap review. |
| `docx` | Document processing | Create, read, edit, comment, redline, and validate Word documents. | No | Yes | No | Unique scripts and XML workflows exist, but licensing is source-available / all-rights-reserved. | `covered` + `reference` | Current document ecosystem covers normal use; official body is reference-only and must not be copied. |
| `frontend-design` | UI design | Produce distinctive, intentional frontend design guidance. | Partial | Yes | Partial | Potential overlap with Product Design, Figma, prototype, and interface-design capabilities. | `reference` / `adapt-candidate` | Avoid duplicate design Skills unless a concrete workflow gap remains after ecosystem comparison. |
| `internal-comms` | Enterprise writing | Draft internal status reports, leadership updates, newsletters, FAQs, and incident communications. | Partial | Partial | No | Native writing can approximate, but reusable templates and examples are not governed here. | `adapt-candidate` | Likely useful Apache-2.0 candidate for business communication workflows. |
| `mcp-builder` | Developer tooling | Build high-quality MCP servers with API integration, SDK patterns, and evaluation. | Partial | Partial | No | Existing plugin/developer tooling does not fully govern MCP-specific build/evaluation workflow. | `adapt-candidate` | High-value Apache-2.0 candidate, but must be neutralized away from Claude-only assumptions. |
| `pdf` | Document processing | Read, extract, create, split, merge, watermark, OCR, and validate PDFs. | No | Yes | No | Unique helper scripts exist, but licensing is source-available / all-rights-reserved. | `covered` + `reference` | Runtime PDF ecosystem covers ordinary tasks; official scripts remain reference-only. |
| `pptx` | Presentation processing | Create, read, edit, combine, split, template, and validate slide decks. | No | Yes | No | Unique Office helper scripts exist, but licensing is source-available / all-rights-reserved. | `covered` + `reference` | Runtime presentation ecosystem covers ordinary tasks; official scripts remain reference-only. |
| `skill-creator` | Skill authoring | Create, improve, evaluate, benchmark, and package Skills. | Partial | Yes | Partial | Creation is covered; benchmarking/eval assets may not be fully covered. | `covered` / `adapt-candidate` | Use existing creator capabilities first; consider adapting evaluation patterns only after overlap review. |
| `slack-gif-creator` | Media workflow | Create Slack-optimized animated GIFs with validation constraints. | Partial | Partial | No | Slack-specific constraints and media dependency notices require review. | `adapt-candidate` / `reference` | Useful niche workflow, but lower priority and dependency-heavy. |
| `theme-factory` | Theme system | Apply reusable visual themes across slides, docs, reports, and HTML artifacts. | Partial | Partial | No | Theme packs and cross-artifact style rules are not governed here. | `adapt-candidate` | Potentially useful if neutralized into portable theme guidance. |
| `web-artifacts-builder` | Web artifacts | Build complex multi-component Claude.ai HTML artifacts with React/Tailwind/shadcn patterns. | Partial | Partial | Partial | Claude.ai artifact assumptions are not portable; web prototype overlap exists. | `reference` / `adapt-candidate` | Do not import directly; possible future generic web-prototype adapter. |
| `webapp-testing` | Frontend testing | Test local web apps with Playwright, screenshots, browser logs, and server helpers. | Partial | Yes | Partial | Existing Playwright/browser ecosystem covers the core; examples may be useful evidence. | `covered` + `reference` | No import needed unless a concrete testing workflow gap is proven. |
| `xlsx` | Spreadsheet processing | Read, edit, repair, convert, format, calculate, and validate spreadsheets. | No | Yes | No | Unique spreadsheet helper scripts exist, but licensing is source-available / all-rights-reserved. | `covered` + `reference` | Runtime spreadsheet ecosystem covers ordinary tasks; official body is reference-only. |

## Incremental Priority

1. Reference-only baselines: `docx`, `pdf`, `pptx`, `xlsx`, `claude-api`.
2. Strong adaptation candidates after normal intake: `mcp-builder`,
   `internal-comms`, `doc-coauthoring`, and `skill-creator` evaluation
   patterns.
3. Creative/design candidates after overlap and resource review:
   `algorithmic-art`, `canvas-design`, `frontend-design`,
   `slack-gif-creator`, `theme-factory`, and `web-artifacts-builder`.
4. Skip except as dated evidence: `brand-guidelines`.

## Required Future Intake Path

Any future work item that imports or adapts from this baseline must follow the
same gate as every other upstream source:

```text
discover
-> candidate
-> source pin
-> license/provenance check
-> security review
-> portability review
-> overlap review
-> neutralization
-> adaptation
-> validation
-> topology update
-> release manifest update
-> approved release
```

Until that path completes, the official Anthropic Skills remain dated external
baseline evidence only.
